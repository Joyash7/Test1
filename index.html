        the order information and fulfill the demand with reporting capabilities. The website should also be adaptable 
        to frequent updates. </p>
    <h4>Tools used:</h4>
    <p>We coded the project and uploaded different forms and photos to make the website appealing. We

        WordPress, Office365, PowerPoint.</p>
    <h4>Duties:</h4>
    <p>This was a group project. The project was divided in different parts. I researched and found out ways of 
        developing a new website that would help uplift a business’s revenue. One of my parts was to conduct team 
        meeting and record the discussions. Being a team player, I also tested the products to notify the team about 
        the improvements needed. I helped in problem resolution by thinking analytically, managing time, and 
        providing robust solutions. Acting as a helpdesk for the group as Client feedback was also handled by me. I 
        provided feedback from my side as well to the team to help improve the project. </p>
    <h4>Outcome:</h4>
    <p>The project went well. Our client was happy with the product he received. Some findings from the 
        project were that we had charted GANTT charts, UML diagrams, Burn down Charts for the project. The time 
        taken for the completion was within the timeframe provided by the client. We met the objective of our client 
        through our continuous improvement. We had a working shopping website for our client to use. We did face 
        to face class presentation of the project, to show the demonstration of the project. Also, we submitted the 
        report together with the product. </p>
